[21:57:14] <JDllama> Welcome back, SF
[21:57:16] <konotyran> and crash!
[21:57:19] <dna030113a> how awesome would it have been if he said kwanzaa miracle and not xmas?
[21:57:20] <Rufuscrim> Okay my graph has been updated. Let me know if I've missed something, I'm only half awake :)
[21:57:40] <JDllama> Ah, there we go
[21:57:49] <forthepuzzle> hey i noticed the pic of blinky today made  seem like there was tears from his eyes any one else notice this?
[21:57:57] <SeasonsFeces> Testing
[21:58:02] <dna030113a> hes sad santas dead
[21:58:21] <konotyran> looks good!
[21:58:33] <SchubyDoo> I seriously need to re-do this wiki.
[21:58:59] <JDllama> OK, yeah, Blinky does look weird
[21:59:15] <JDllama> Although I guess it's just to not get sued?
[21:59:24] <JDllama> Howdy
[21:59:27] <dna030113a> good luck Doo
[21:59:36] <forthepuzzle> maybe but i is def a difference
[22:00:12] <JTobcat> could just be from scaling the original blinky down to a 10x10 grid
[22:00:17] <SchubyDoo> Ok opinion, should each 'Interesting Clue' have it's own Wiki or should they all be listed like they are now on another page?
[22:00:23] <forthepuzzle> he may be crying or just an anti copy right thing i just had not seen anyone else talk about it
[22:01:05] <SeasonsFeces> MURDERER
[22:01:06] <konotyran> because ther emight be multipule theorys for each clue later
[22:01:11] <konotyran> make it easier to list them all
[22:01:15] <SchubyDoo> taking notes here, I plan to re-do it this weekend.
[22:01:33] <SchubyDoo> Good point.
[22:01:36] <SeasonsFeces> OK, test one more time
[22:01:38] <SchubyDoo> Taking suggestions on the wiki!
[22:01:44] <JDllama> Awesome
[22:01:58] <SchubyDoo> Come one come all!  Get your voice heard!
[22:02:03] <JDllama> COMIC SANS
[22:02:13] <SchubyDoo> Hah
[22:02:22] <SchubyDoo> I wonder if the Wiki allows css somehow.
[22:02:28] <PaulBlano> Hey.
[22:02:37] <SchubyDoo> Howdy
[22:02:58] <SchubyDoo> Everyone, I was *almost* mean today.  I wanted to sneak something in the wiki to make it look like a puzzle.  But I just couldn't do it.
[22:03:06] <konotyran> lol
[22:03:24] <JDllama> ....
[22:04:49] <jrbudda> he said there wasnt a mistake
[22:04:55] <jrbudda> and they just screwed something up
[22:05:08] <forthepuzzle> slang maybe
[22:05:08] <jrbudda> if you look at slinkers posts on reddit
[22:05:13] <konotyran> [â€“]selinker ???? 8 points 4 hours ago
[22:05:14] <konotyran> Whoops. Hang loose. Just a slight adjustment, and it'll be right back.
[22:05:20] <dna030113a> well if they screwed it up its a mistake >>
[22:05:23] <forthepuzzle> like wurd to ya homies
[22:05:27] <konotyran> https://www.reddit.com/r/holidaybullshit/comments/2p0ppn/general_the_crosswurd_is_no_longer_in_the_day_4/cms9iaa
[22:05:54] <sivart84> the screw up might have been that it was removed at all, not any issue with the puzzle itself
[22:05:56] <konotyran> he said it will be back..
[22:20:34] <jrbudda> so theres one one each that's exclusive?
[22:24:04] <Onomatopoesis> Yay! Thank you, @SchubyDoo
[22:24:05] <JDllama> With its song.
[22:24:09] <ThymeCypher> :)
[22:24:13] <jrbudda> !botsnack
[22:24:18] <PaulBlano> Do we have a running thread for the differences in the envelopes and wallpapers?
[22:24:19] <jrbudda> :(
[22:24:24] <SeasonsFeces> NO BOTSNACK DAMMIT
[22:24:31] <jrbudda> lol
[22:24:54] <PaulBlano> Some of them seem pretty big.
[22:24:55] <ThymeCypher> So, is the line above your name something for management of the letters, for the post office, or a clue?
[22:25:06] <JDllama> OK, letting this run for a few minutes; if it doesn't act up, I have one more update
[22:25:08] <JTobcat> i dont think there is anything to be gained from the differences between envelopes and wallpapers
[22:25:12] <JDllama> and that update...is for SchubyDoo ;)
[22:25:19] <SchubyDoo> TIs for a rapper?  Can someone explain that to me?
[22:25:22] <SchubyDoo> haha thanks JDllama 
[22:25:26] <jrbudda> TI is a rapper
[22:25:27] <JTobcat> I think he we are getting the first drafts pics on the envelopes, and the wallpapers are the final drafts
[22:25:31] <Onomatopoesis> @ThymeCypher That is a damn good question and I think we don't totally know?
[22:25:41] <konotyran> rapper name is T.I. so "it belongs to the rapper woudl be T.I.'s
[22:25:43] <konotyran> thus TIS
[22:25:48] <ThymeCypher> I haven't seen it on the reddit but the first envelope has the unique code that's also on your personalized card.
[22:26:05] <SchubyDoo> jrbudda, I should really listen to more music.
[22:26:06] <Onomatopoesis> @JTobcat Did you listen to the Cryptex Podcast today?
[22:26:09] <ThymeCypher> The rest have gobblygook.
[22:26:16] <loanlyrd> i cant think of any other 3 letter word that fits besides TIS
[22:26:17] <jrbudda> SchubyDoo: i had no idea til they posted it
[22:26:18] <JTobcat> did not listen to todays yet
[22:26:23] <jrbudda> i was going with mc hammer
[22:26:25] <jrbudda> cause im old
[22:26:33] <Onomatopoesis> They talked about that question, you should give it a listen
[22:26:40] <JTobcat> haha, will do
[22:27:13] <kmrly> kototyran schubydoo I still think the rapper answer is going to be more intentional than that. We basically said "find a 2-letter rapper name and make it possessive" -- that's too random.
[22:27:26] <Onomatopoesis> I think some of the differences are relevant, even if it's for no better reason than to draw our attention to certain things
[22:27:31] <dancemart> For the crossword have people have any theories on 2 and 3? I assumed siri and reg. Since it is clear we have an unreliable narrator for the puzzle, we might be able to go over the allotted slots.
[22:27:56] <Onomatopoesis> @dancemart SIRI is four letters. But HER is three.
[22:27:57] <sivart84> I'm pretty confident that those are HER and REG
[22:27:59] <loanlyrd> 2 is HER
[22:28:07] <Onomatopoesis> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_%28film%29
[22:28:09] <jrbudda> possessives are a very very common device in crosswords to add an S to the end of words
[22:28:11] <kmrly> dancemart 2= HER 3= REG
[22:28:34] <JDllama> SchubyDoo: get my PM?
[22:28:41] <dancemart> ah I see, I was working under the assumption of an unreliable narrator.
[22:28:47] <kmrly> jrbudda right but there are more 2-letter rapper names than just TI, several came up earlier
[22:28:59] <invent0rjoe> LL...BG...

[22:29:01] <SeasonsFeces> New post: http://www.reddit.com/r/holidaybullshit/comments/2p1kzx/clue_borathamm/
[22:29:10] <invent0rjoe> MM
[22:29:11] <konotyran> yea but I fits for Ion and NET for the other two connected
[22:29:17] <JDllama> w00t!
[22:29:18] <jrbudda> yea i like ion and net
[22:29:19] <dancemart> I like TIS as well because the narrator could misconstrue tis as in tis the season as a rapper.
[22:29:22] <invent0rjoe> and I think .onl makes more sense than .net
[22:29:33] <sivart84> ONL is interesting
[22:29:43] <invent0rjoe> it stands for .online basically
[22:29:44] <JDllama> YAY the bot works!
[22:29:47] <konotyran> .onl? ive never heard of that extnesion before
[22:29:50] <sivart84> I didn't even realize it was a tld
[22:30:18] <kmrly> watch this all fall to pieces when the pdf gets updated
[22:30:20] <loanlyrd> ION becomes ISO maybe
[22:30:45] <konotyran> what is ISO, and how is it related to a 'physics thing'
[22:31:00] <invent0rjoe> it might not even start with I
[22:31:13] <konotyran> it might not.
[22:31:16] <ThymeCypher> I'm iffy on .onl
[22:31:25] <JDllama> w00t!
[22:31:26] <loanlyrd> iso is a physics standard
[22:31:26] <ThymeCypher> It's not even a year old for a TLD.
[22:31:30] <SeasonsFeces> New post: http://www.reddit.com/r/holidaybullshit/comments/2p1lab/theory_the_seti_theory/
[22:31:50] <ThymeCypher> loanlyrd, you mean the standards organization?
[22:32:10] <invent0rjoe> wow that post is a complex wall of text
[22:32:24] <jrbudda> oh lord he does like that seti theory
[22:32:35] <invent0rjoe> needs more paragraphs
[22:32:44] <loanlyrd> yeah thymecypher - i just know it is something with science related from back in college
[22:32:55] <loanlyrd> maybe way off base, who knows
[22:33:02] <ThymeCypher> They do standards for just about everything technology and science.
[22:33:11] <konotyran> ohh god. O_o i wish people would stop "well this word pulls up the safe so it must be important" threads.
[22:33:32] <invent0rjoe> yeah the pictures aren't important until you know the word...
[22:33:44] <lennylane> I'm out for the night.  Goodnight all.
[22:33:47] <konotyran> they keep typing random words into the picture generator and trying to gleam meanigns of off of connections.
[22:33:51] <ThymeCypher> I'm pretty sure the safe means absolutely nothing...
[22:33:58] <jrbudda> the thing about this crossword is he probbably  made up the grid first, and thought up clues to fit
[22:34:01] <invent0rjoe> I'm sure other words bring up those pictures too
[22:34:07] <jrbudda> so the answer needs to evoke teh clue
[22:34:21] <loanlyrd> i would agree
[22:35:10] <GoblinArmy> putting words into the image generator is this year's anagramming / coal-rubbing
[22:35:15] <kratsg> Ugh. People need to read the dang wiki.
[22:35:16] <Onomatopoesis> heehee
[22:35:35] <JDllama> What? Reading?
[22:35:39] <JDllama> Who does that?
[22:35:40] <PaulBlano> Could 1D be POT?
[22:35:47] <JDllama> That sounds like communist talk.
[22:36:04] <kratsg> Most people are still talking about groupings of 3 and the images... when we've got that covered with a single app. They need to shift their energies elsewhere.
[22:36:18] <kratsg> JDllama: are you a channel mod now?
[22:36:23] <Onomatopoesis> I am constantly reading the Wiki, but it seems like there are three dozen new clues or possible-clues every day
[22:36:23] <JDllama> I'm just a +V
[22:36:32] <JDllama> Schuby's the only mod
[22:36:39] <Onomatopoesis> on the sub as a whole, I mean
[22:36:40] <kratsg> Weird, maybe the web app is glitchy
[22:36:47] <JDllama> My plus sign brings all the boys to the yard.
[22:37:18] <konotyran> awe :( i want a pluss sign too
[22:37:22] <dancemart> + Is your plus sign better than mine?
[22:37:39] <kratsg> Meh, I want a plus sign.
[22:37:47] <kratsg> SchubyDoo: DoobyDoooooooo
[22:37:50] <konotyran> revolt!
[22:37:59] <JDllama> ANARCHY IN THE IRC
[22:38:04] <PaulBlano> Did we add anything about the Yesteryear stuff on the wiki?
[22:38:05] <Onomatopoesis> omg, is everyone gonna start begging for op privileges now?
[22:38:06] <kratsg> So I can't figure out the lights.
[22:38:07] <darkcranium> are you replying to me kono
[22:38:11] <Onomatopoesis> It's like being in middle school again
[22:38:25] <jrbudda> will trade blowjob for asterisk
[22:38:38] <konotyran> + is not OP. its voice. it means if the chanel goes moderated only people with "voice" can talk
[22:38:43] <konotyran> its an IRC thing
[22:38:49] <kratsg> Also, I'm pretty sure the Picross picture is not blinky.
[22:39:01] <SeasonsFeces> New post: http://www.reddit.com/r/holidaybullshit/comments/2p1m5i/theory_state_your_admissions/
[22:39:03] <kratsg> The eye isn't even self-symmetrical.
[22:39:13] <konotyran> the numbers on the envelope?
[22:39:17] <GoblinArmy> maybe it's blinky after he looked at the ark of the covenant
[22:39:33] <darkcranium> not sure if anyone has this yet but when I searched yellow train a pic come up of a train car with thb on it
[22:39:34] <JDllama> kratsg:I think that's a design choice, though
[22:39:39] <jrbudda> 10x10 isnt a lot of pixels tho
[22:39:49] <kratsg> Is SeasonsFeces a bot?
[22:39:49] <JTobcat> its just a smashed blinky because they scaled him down to a 10x10 grid
[22:39:50] <Onomatopoesis> I know,  back in the day we called those op privileges from "operator"
[22:40:01] <JDllama> Hell, even the original design of Blinky had that extra bit of white at the bottom; it's just that this time, they got rid of a pixel of white
[22:40:03] <konotyran> darkcranium: thats where pople are getting TCH from. she though she may have ben high. TCH= chemical in pot.
[22:40:15] <SeasonsFeces> I AM THE GREATEST BOT EVER
[22:40:21] <kratsg> JTobcat: If they were going to scale him down, it would be symmetric... around the eyes. It's not that hard.
[22:40:21] <Onomatopoesis> @konotyran THC
[22:40:23] <konotyran> now you rjust showing off
[22:40:29] <konotyran> er lol yea THC*
[22:40:31] <konotyran> sorry
[22:40:35] <SeasonsFeces> Maybe.
[22:40:49] <GoblinArmy> I like big BOTs and I cannot lie
[22:40:56] <JDllama> You other coders can't deny.
[22:40:58] <ThymeCypher> I don't think it's safe to say it's blinky yet.
[22:40:58] <pervy> ThymeCypher, that's what she said! (p=0.9904)
[22:41:03] <konotyran> ohh boy
[22:41:03] <pervy> konotyran, that's what she said! (p=1.0000)
[22:41:14] <JDllama> MY ANACONDA DON'T WANT NONE UNLESS YOU PARSE STRINGS, HON
[22:41:14] <pervy> JDllama, that's what she said! (p=0.9883)
[22:41:20] <konotyran> facepalm.gif
[22:41:29] <ThymeCypher> She didn't say that, konotyran.
[22:41:30] <PaulBlano> For the lights, I liked this idea: http://www.reddit.com/r/holidaybullshit/comments/2ox33l/clue_download_todays_yesteryear/cmrc74z
[22:41:48] <kratsg> People, please use my damn app forimages. http://holidaybullshit2014.herokuapp.com/
[22:41:55] <kratsg> You can even link an image ID: http://holidaybullshit2014.herokuapp.com/image/500
[22:42:01] <kratsg> #magic
[22:42:06] <JTobcat> @PaulBlano yea, that idea didn't go anywhere
[22:42:06] <pervy> JTobcat, that's what she said! (p=0.9865)
[22:42:18] <konotyran> PaulBlano: i looked over that a lot. i tired to put it with everythign form last year didnt get anywhere
[22:42:18] <pervy> konotyran, that's what she said! (p=0.9733)
[22:42:26] <kratsg> !quit pervy
[22:42:42] <SeasonsFeces> I wish I knew how to quit you.
[22:42:47] <konotyran> hell i even tried to anargam it to butbeforeikillyoumrbondimustshowyouthemeaningofchristmas.com
[22:42:50] <kratsg> f3
[22:42:54] <ThymeCypher> YOU CAM IN LIKE A WRECKING BALL
[22:42:55] <konotyran> and all the cards used to get BOND MEANING
[22:43:00] <konotyran> got nowhere
[22:43:11] <SchubyDoo> battle of the bots?
[22:43:24] <JTobcat> I thought with it being a group of 6, then 5, it somehow told us to use something from each line of the initial insert on day 1
[22:43:34] <kratsg> I quit pervy... do you want me to bring him back up? >.>
[22:43:38] <GoblinArmy> they already had a BattleBots show, and it was turrrrrible
[22:44:04] <ThymeCypher> How did that card get figured out anyway?
[22:44:13] <kratsg> That's so hard.
[22:44:13] <pervy> kratsg, that's what she said! (p=0.9979)
[22:44:24] <SeasonsFeces> LIGHTNING BOLT! LIGHTNING BOLT!
[22:44:24] <ThymeCypher> Actually, two cards if I'm not mistaken - I believe there is a "The meaning of christmas" card.
[22:44:43] <SeasonsFeces> I CAST MAGIC MISSILE AT THE DARKNESS.
[22:44:55] <ThymeCypher> I know "But before I kill you..." is a card simply because that's when everyone decides to play their dick cards.
[22:45:14] <kratsg> My Biggest Blackest Dick?
[22:45:14] <pervy> kratsg, that's what she said! (p=1.0000)
[22:45:21] <SeasonsFeces> OK, moving myself off of JDllama's compy
[22:45:28] <SchubyDoo> JTobcat, are you not registered?
